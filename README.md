    - In the Next step, Select `Drivers` option to access the atlas database using our Node.js project
    - Copy the `connection string` and paste the `connection string` inside `config.json` file
    - Replace `<password>` in the connection string with the your userâ€™s password

4. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a .env file in the `backend` folder
    - Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection details)

5. Start the server by running:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
6. Open the `frontend` folder:
    - Navigate to the `frontend/travel-story-app` folder.
    - Run the following command to install the required dependencies: 
        ```bash

        ```
    - After the installation is complete, start the React development server by running:
